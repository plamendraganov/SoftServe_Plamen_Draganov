    "instructions": "INSTRUCTIONS: Whisk yogurt with 4 whole eggs. Add cheese, salt and pepper and mix. Melt the butter. Take two sheets of phyllo and brush with melted butter. Superimpose a third sheet on the first and brush with butter. Turn over and then brush the non coated side. Divide ¼ of the yogurt, egg and cheese mixture on top of the filo sheets. Then roll the whole preparation like a long sausage. Roll lengthwise to get the roll as long as possible. Repeat this process 3 more times to get 4 long rolls of three superimposed sheets of filo each. Place the springform pan on a baking sheet (or just circle on baking sheet covered with parchment paper). Begin by placing the first roll by sticking to the edge of the circle, then add the following forming a snail to the center. Beat egg yolk with the remaining melted butter and brush the whole banitsa. Bake at 400 F for about 25 minutes. The banitsa should be golden. It can be eaten either hot, warm or cold."
