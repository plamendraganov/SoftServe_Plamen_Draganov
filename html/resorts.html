                      enjoy their contact with wild nature. There are lot of tents and whole families
                      live there from June to September. </p>

                    <p>Sozopol is one of the oldest towns on Bulgarian Thrace's Black Sea coast. The first
                       settlement on the site dates back to the Bronze Age. Undersea explorations in the
                        region of the port reveal relics of dwellings, ceramic pottery, stone
                        and bone tools from that era. Many anchors from the second and first millennium
                        BC have been discovered in the town's bay, a proof of active shipping since ancient
                         times.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>The town was founded in the 7th century BC by Greek colonists from Miletus as
                      Antheia. The town established itself as a trade and naval centre in the following
                      centuries and became one of the largest and richest Greek colonies in the
                        Black Sea region. Apollonia became a legendary trading rival of another Greek
                        colony, Mesembria, today’s Nessebar.</p>

                    <p>Originally a Thracian settlement, known as Menebria, the town became a Greek
                      colony when settled by Dorians from Megara at the beginning of the 6th century BC,
                       and was an important trading centre from then on and a rival of Apollonia
                        (Sozopol). It remained the only Dorian colony along the Black Sea coast, as the
                         rest were typical Ionian colonies. At 425-424 BC the town joined the Delian
                          League, under the leadership of Athens.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>Remains date mostly from the Hellenistic period and include the acropolis, a
                      temple of Apollo and an agora. A wall which formed part of the Thracian fortifications
                       can still be seen on the north side of the peninsula.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>Bronze and silver coins were minted in the city since the 5th century BC and
                      gold coins since the 3rd century BC. The town fell under Roman rule in 71 BC, yet
                      continued to enjoy privileges such as the right to mint its own coinage.</p>
