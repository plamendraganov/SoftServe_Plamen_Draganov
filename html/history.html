                    <p>Cape Kaliakra has long been regarded as a point of key strategic significance.
                       In 1444, while marching south to face the Ottoman Empire, King Władysław III of
                       Poland made camp at Kaliakra. He would later lose his life in the Battle
                        of Varna, to be honoured with the title Vladislav of Varna, or ‘Vladislav
                        Varnenchik’ </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>The cape was to play a key role once again, in the later Russo-Turkish War. It
                      was here that the Russian Admiral Fyodor Ushakov sailed south to smash the Turkish
                       fleet. The Battle of Cape Kaliakra, fought on 11 August 1791, was the
                        fiercest naval battle the Black Sea had ever seen and brought an end to the
                         Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1791.</p>

                    <p>The Late Antiquity and Early Byzantine fortress on the Cape of St. Athanasius
                      near the Bulgarian Black Sea town of Byala, District of Varna, has been
                       rediscovered by Bulgarian archaeologists in recent years. The fortress is
                       located on a plot of about 40 decares (app. 10 acres), and is dated back to
                       the 5th-6th century AD while the precise area of an ancient settlement located
                       on the same site remains unknown. The Early Byzantine fortress has been dated more
                        precisely to the reigns of Byzantine Emperors Anastasius I (r. 491-518 AD),
                        and Justinian I (r. 527-565 AD). </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>Before the excavations in recent years, the fortress on the Cape of St. Athanasius
                       had only been known from a 1892 note by Czech-Bulgarian archaeologists Karel and
                       Hermann Skorpil known as the founders of contemporary Bulgarian archaeology,
                       and from a brief expedition in the 1970s. </p>

                      the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. The complex appeared as a summer residence
                        of the Romanian queen Maria (1875-1938).</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>The visitors to the palace and the botanical garden are especially interested in

                    <p>The Thracian sanctuary Beglik Tash is located in the highest part of cape
                       Beglik Tash (128 meters above sea level), near Primorsko. It covers an area of
                       6 decares. It is located in a forest territory, which used to be part of the
                       hunting residence of the former communist head of the state Todor Zhivkov
                        (ruled 1954 – 1989). Therefore one of the greatest discoveries regarding the
                        Thracian history on the southern Black Sea coast and Strandzha remained unknown
                         to science until 2003.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>Pottery, stone tools and weapons, flints, coins, etc. were found during
                      archaeological explorations. They show that the place was created in the middle
                      of the 2nd millennium BC and was destroyed in the beginning of the 4th century
                        AD. The lack of later constructions upon it has allowed the preservation of the
                        unique sacred elements in their original form.</p>

                    <p>St. Anastasia Island is located in the Burgas Bay in the Black Sea. It is a
                      volcanic rock island, 12 meters high, at some places up to 17 meters high, and its
                      area is almost 9 decres. Between 1959 and 1990 it was known as Bolshevik
                        Island. It is surrounded by mystery and there are hundreds of legends and stories
                        about it.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>St. Anastasia Island is the only Bulgarian Island which has a church – “Ascension”,
                       which is part of the monastery, which once existed there. The earliest information
                       on the existence of the sanctuary dates from 15th century. Throughout
                        the years the monastery was burnt down a few times and raided by pirates. The
                         murals are suggested to date from 14th century.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>A healing place, offering wonder-working herbs and potions from old recipes,
                      medieval monastery cell, where you can stay overnight, restaurant with authentic
                       Burgas meals from old recipes…all this in the most romantic place in the
                        Burgas Bay – St. Anastasia Island. You can get there on a boat, leaving from
